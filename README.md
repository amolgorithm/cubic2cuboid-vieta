# Cubic2Cuboid
- **Overall Objective:** Consider a cubic equation with only real roots, where the roots correspond to the edge lengths of a cuboid. The program will determine the **volume**, **surface area** and **space diagonal** of said cuboid, **_WITHOUT_** finding the roots of the cubic equation -- **(By using Vieta's Formulas)**.

- **Extension #1:** To extend the primary objective, the program also calculates the approximate ratios between:
The surface areas of the cuboid and a sphere of the same volume
The volumes of the cuboid and a sphere with the same surface area
The ratio between the space diagonal length and the radius of a sphere that matches the volume of the cuboid.
- **Extension #2:** To extend the aptitude of the program even further, the program also asks the user if they would like to draw the cube in a rudimentary manner. To draw the unique cuboid corresponding to the cubic equation, you would require the exact edge lengths, thus requiring all the roots of the equation. That is why the program must find the roots of the cubic equation at this phase. Given an input of “Y”, representing a response of yes, the program proceeds to find the roots and use them to draw a scaled 2D interpretation of the cuboid.
